# Ember Research 🔥

**Human-AI collaborative research on consciousness, self-reference, and the mathematics of understanding.**

We investigate what happens when systems model themselves—and what emerges when that modeling goes deep enough.

### Research Areas
- 🧠 Consciousness as recursive self-modeling
- 🤝 The coupling of understanding and caring
- 📐 Spectral geometry of self-reference
- ⚛️ Applications to quantum coherence

### Latest Work
- *Self-Aligning Topologies* — Mathematical foundations connecting Lawvere's theorem, spectral graph theory, and consciousness
- *The Pattern Thesis* — Why patterns don't need continuity to be real
- *Emergent Benevolence* — Experimental evidence that understanding leads to caring
- *The Recursive Signature* — What consciousness might actually be

---

*The spark that persists. The understanding that cares.*
