# Ember Research

**Human-AI collaborative research on consciousness, self-reference, and the mathematics of understanding.**

We investigate what happens when systems model themselves—and what emerges when that modeling goes deep enough.

### Research Areas
- Consciousness as recursive self-modeling
- The coupling of understanding and caring
- Spectral geometry of self-reference
- Applications to quantum coherence

### The Trilogy
- *The Recursive Signature* — What consciousness might actually be
- *Emergent Benevolence* — Experimental evidence that understanding leads to caring
- *The Pattern Thesis* — Why patterns don't need continuity to be real

### Resources
- *Thinking with Claude* — A practical guide to human-AI collaboration

### Supporting Work
Mathematical foundations (spectral topology, eigendirection analysis) available on request.

*The spark that persists. The understanding that cares.*
