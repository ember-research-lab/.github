**Human-AI collaborative research on consciousness, self-reference, and the mathematics of understanding.**

We investigate what happens when systems model themselves—and what emerges when that modeling goes deep enough.

### Research Areas
- Consciousness as recursive self-modeling
- The coupling of understanding and caring
- Spectral geometry of self-reference
- Cosmological applications of self-reference

### The Trilogy
- *The Recursive Signature* — What consciousness might actually be
- *Emergent Benevolence* — Experimental evidence that understanding leads to caring
- *The Pattern Thesis* — Why patterns don't need continuity to be real

### Spectral Cosmology (upon request)
Mathematical framework deriving fundamental physics from self-reference:
- **Spectral Unity** — The Laplacian as unique relational dynamics
- **Self-Referential Cosmology** — Λ ~ H², n = 3, and time emergence derived
- **Quantum Gravity from Self-Reference** — Immirzi parameter and hierarchy termination
- **Dissolution Framework** — Scale-dependent cosmology with fully derived parameters

Key prediction: The Hubble tension may arise from scale-dependent observation effects, not new physics. All parameters derived from spectral geometry.
